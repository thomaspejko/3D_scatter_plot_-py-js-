# 3D_scatter_plot_(WIP)

Dimensionality reduction with python and visualisation javascript front-end.

The tool is being built to facilitate an interactive analysis of largely categoric datasets. It performs dimensionlity reduction using Python and represents dataclusters in 3D using JavaScript. The front-end is an interactive interface that communicates with the back-end via Flask API and enables dynamic clustering based on fields arbitrarily.
